## Application Architecture

### Activity Management System
The core functionality revolves around a comprehensive activity listing mechanism that displays educational content in a user-friendly card-based layout. Each activity presents essential information including title, type classification, current status, associated dates, and recommended next actions.

### Filtering and Search Infrastructure
The application implements a sophisticated filtering system utilizing chip-based interface components, enabling real-time content filtering across multiple activity categories with immediate visual feedback.

### Modal Detail System
A comprehensive modal popup system provides in-depth activity information, ensuring users have access to complete details without navigation disruption.

### Theme Management Architecture
The application incorporates a robust theming system supporting both light and dark modes with persistent state management and automatic system theme detection capabilities.

## Design Rationale and Technical Decisions

### UI Framework Selection: React Native Paper

The selection of React Native Paper as the primary UI library was based on several technical and practical considerations:

- **Material Design 3 Compliance**: Ensures modern, consistent design standards
- **Cross-Platform Optimization**: Native performance across web and mobile platforms  
- **Integrated Theming System**: Built-in support for dynamic theme switching
- **Comprehensive Component Ecosystem**: Extensive library of pre-built, tested components
- **Maintenance and Support**: Active development community and regular updates
